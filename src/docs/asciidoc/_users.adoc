== User Management

=== User information

The API allows to get information on the currently logged on user
via a `GET` on `/api/users/me`. If you are not a logged on user, the
following response will be returned:

// Deprecated?
// operation::own-details-unauthorized[snippets='http-request,http-response']

==== HTTP request
include::{snippets}/own-details-unauthorized/http-request.adoc[]
==== HTTP response
include::{snippets}/own-details-unauthorized/http-response.adoc[]

If you do log on as a user, you get more information on that user:

// operation::own-details[snippets='http-request,http-response,response-fields']

==== HTTP request
include::{snippets}/own-details/http-request.adoc[]

==== HTTP response
include::{snippets}/own-details/http-response.adoc[]

==== Response fields
include::{snippets}/own-details/response-fields.adoc[]
